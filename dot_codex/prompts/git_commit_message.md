# **Improve Git Commit Message**

Task: For the most recent staged commit, modify the commit message to ensure it is descriptive in detail.


## Context and Example Behavior: 

- Run git status, determine staged commit ahead of origin. 
- Retrieve the most recent commit with git log -1 --stat. 
- Assess commit diff (insertions, deletions, files changed). 
- Attempt git commit --amend with detailed message. 
- If permission denied (e.g., index.lock), investigate directory permissions and escalate if appropriate. 
- Re-run amend step upon user approval. 
- Confirm commit updated successfully. 
- Summarize steps taken and advise user to run git push --force-with-lease after amending.


## Expected Output: 

- A refined commit message including: 
    - Clear title summarizing changes. 
    - Bullet points describing test suites, config additions, refactors, relevant modules, and any batch runner updates. 
- Notes on example configs, file movements, and added documentation.

## Usage: 

- Codex should read current repo status. 
- Amend the latest commit message with a detailed and structured explanation. 
- Provide final instructions regarding pushing amended history.
